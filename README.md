# Music-Recommendation-System

 ## Overview

This project is a Music Recommendation System that uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze song data and suggest recommendations. It processes textual features like lyrics and descriptions, transforming them into vectors to compute song similarity using cosine similarity.	 

## Features

* Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the music dataset for analysis.
* Text Vectorization: Uses TF-IDF to convert textual data into numerical features.
* Similarity Analysis: Computes song similarity with cosine similarity.
* Recommendation Functionality: Generates music recommendations based on user input or preferences.

## How It Works

* Data Loading: The system reads a dataset (CSV format) containing song metadata like lyrics and descriptions.
* Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, removes noise, and processes text data (e.g., stemming).
* Feature Extraction: Text data is vectorized using TF-IDF to capture important features.
* Similarity Calculation: Measures cosine similarity to determine how closely songs are related.
* Recommendation: Suggests songs with high similarity scores to the input.

## Requirements
